An additional goal for today is for you to be introduced to your teams and practice collaborating using GitHub and RStudio. Packages We will use the following packages in today’s assignment: library(tidyverse) library(skimr) library(broom) library(rcfss) Data We will analyze the scorecard dataset from the rcfss package. This dataset contains information about 1849 colleges obtained from the Department of Education’s College Scorecard. Load the rcfss library into the global R environment and type ?scorecard in the console to learn more about the dataset and variable definitions. This analysis will focus on the following variables: type Type of college (Public, Private - nonprofit, Private - for profit) cost The average annual cost of attendance, including tuition and feeds, books and supplies, and living expenses, minus the average grant/scholarship aid admrate Undergraduate admissions rate (from 0 - 100%) Exercises Exploratory Data Analysis Plot a histogram to examine the distribution of admrate. Describe the shape of the distribution. To better understand the distribution of admrate, we would like calculate measures of center and spread of the distribution. Fill in the code below to use the skim function to calculate summary statistics for admrate. Report the appropriate measures of center (mean or median) and spread (standard deviation or IQR) based on the shape of the distribution from Exercise 1. scorecard %&gt;% select(admrate) %&gt;% skim() Plot the distribution of cost and calculate the appropriate summary statistics. Describe the distribution of cost (shape, center, and spread) using the plot and appropriate summary statistics. One nice feature of the skim function is that it provides information about the number of observations that are missing values of the variable. How many observations have missing values of admrate? How many observations have missing values of cost? Later in the semester, we will techniques to deal with missing values in the data. For now, however, only include complete observations for the remainder of this analysis. You can use the filter function to select only the rows that values for both cost and admrate. (Note: Learn more about the filter function in [Section 5.2 of R for Data Science] (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter).) Fill in the code below to create a new dataset called scorecard_new that only includes observations with values for both admrate and cost. __________ &lt;- scorecard %&gt;% filter(!is.na(admrate),________) # You will use scorecard_new for the rest of the assignment. Create a scatterplot to display the relationship between cost (response variable) and admrate (explanatory variable). Use the scatterplot to describe the relationship between the two variables. The data contains information about the type of college, and we would like to incorporate this information into the scatterplot. One way to do this is to use a different color marker for each type of college. Fill in the code below the scatterplot from the previous exercise with the marker colors based on the variable type. Describe two new observations from this scatterplot that you didn’t see in the previous plot. ggplot(data=scorecard_new, mapping=aes(x=admrate, y=cost, color=type)) + _____________________ Simple Linear Regression Fit a regression model to describe the relationship between a college’s admission rate and cost. Use the tidy function to display the model. Interpret the slope in the context of the problem. Does the intercept have a meaningful interpretation? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the problem. Otherwise, explain why the interpretation is not meaningful. While the tidy function is used to display the model, we can obtain a one-row summary of the model using the glance function. Use the glance function to get a summary of the model fit in the previous exercise. See the documentation for glance for the syntax and a list of values output from the function. What is the value of \\(R^2\\)? Interpret this value in the context of the problem. Do you think this is a “good” value of \\(R^2\\)? Explain. What is the value of \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\), the residual standard error. What is the 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of admrate, i.e. the slope? Interpret the interval in the context of the data. We want to test the following hypotheses about the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\): \\[H_0: \\beta_1 = 0 \\hspace{5mm} \\text{versus} \\hspace{5mm} H_a: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\] State what the null and alternative hypotheses mean in terms of the linear relationship between admrate and cost. Consider the confidence interval from Exercise 13 and the hypotheses in Exercise 14. Does this confidence interval seem to be consistent with the null or alternative hypothesis? Briefly explain. Knit then commit all remaining changes, write a commit message indiciating you’re finished, and push to GitHub. Before you finish, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo. 5.2 IN-CLASS: Advertising &amp; Sales In this mini analysis, we will work with the Advertising data used in Chapters 2 and 3 of (James et al. 2017). Packages library(readr) library(tidyverse) library(skimr) library(broom) Data advertising &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/advertising.csv&quot;) This dataset contains the advertising spending and sales for 200 markets. The variables are tv: total spending on TV advertising (in $thousands) radio: total spending on radio advertising (in $thousands) newspaper: total spending on newspaper advertising (in $thousands) sales: total sales (in $millions) Exercises We’ll begin the analysis by getting quick view of the data: glimpse(advertising) Next, we can calculate summary statistics for each of the variables in the data set. advertising %&gt;% skim() What type of advertising has the smallest median spending? What type of advertising has the largest variation in spending? Describe the shape of the distribution of sales. We are most interested in understanding how advertising spending affect sales. One way to quantify the relationship between the variables is by calculating the correlation matrix. advertising %&gt;% cor() What is the correlation between radio and sales? Interpret this value. What type of advertising has the strongest linear relationship with sales? Below are visualizations of sales versus each explanatory variable. advertising %&gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=tv,y=sales)) + geom_point(alpha=0.7) + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE,color=&quot;blue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Sales vs. TV Advertising&quot;, x= &quot;TV Advertising (in $thousands)&quot;, y=&quot;_____&quot;) #fill in the Y axis label advertising %&gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=radio,y=sales)) + geom_point(alpha=0.7) + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE,color=&quot;red&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Sales vs. TV Advertising&quot;, x= &quot;Radio Advertising (in $thousands)&quot;, y=&quot;Sales (in $millions)&quot;) advertising %&gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=newspaper,y=sales)) + geom_point(alpha=0.7) + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE,color=&quot;purple&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Sales vs. Newspaper Advertising&quot;, x= &quot;Newspaper Advertising (in $thousands)&quot;, y=&quot;Sales (in $millions)&quot;) Since tv appears to have the strongest linear relationship with sales, let’s calculate a simple linear regression model using these two variables. ad_model &lt;- lm(sales ~ tv, data=advertising) ad_model Write the model equation. Does it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, interpret the intercept in the context of the problem. Otherwise, briefly explain why not. Interpret the slope in the context of the problem. 5.3 IN-CLASS: Carbohydrates in Beer Packages library(tidyverse) library(readr) library(broom) Data beer &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/beer.csv&quot;) In this analysis, we will analyze the relationship between the amount of alcohol (PercentAlcohol) and the caloric content (CaloriesPer12Oz) in domestic beers. Let PercentAlcohol be the predictor variable and CaloriesPer12Oz the response variable. Exercises Due to limited class time, we will not do the exploratory data analysis in this example. In practice, however, you should always start with the exploratory data analysis. Fit a regression model to describe the relationship between PercentAlcohol and CaloriesPer12Oz. Display the model output. # code for regression model Does it make sense to interpret the intercept? Why or why not? Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the slope in the context of the data. Calculate the critical value, \\(t^*\\), used to calculate the 95% confidence interval. The code below is a guide; uncomment and complete the lines of code to calculate and display the critical value. n &lt;- nrow(beer) #df &lt;- _________ #crit_val &lt;- qt(_____,df) #crit_val The critical value used to calculate the 95% confident interval for the slope is ____. Interpret the test statistic in the context of the data. How was the p-value calculated? Fill in the code below to calculate the p-value. The code below is a guide; uncomment and complete the lines of code to calculate and display the p-value. #test_statistic &lt;- _______ #prob &lt;- 1 - pt(abs(test_statistic),df) #p_value &lt;- 2 * prob #p_value The p-value is ____ . Given there is no linear relationship between PercentAlcohol and CaloriesPer12Oz, the probability of obtaining a test statistic with magnitude ____ or more extreme is ____. Fill in the code below to calculate the predicted calories and corresponding 90% interval for a single beer with alcohol content of 4.3%. x0 &lt;- data.frame(PercentAlcohol=4.3) #predict.lm(model,x0,interval=&quot;________&quot;,conf.level=________) #&lt;&lt; Fill in the code below to calculate the predicted calories and corresponding 90% interval for the subset of beers with alcohol content of 4.3%. x0 &lt;- data.frame(PercentAlcohol=4.3) #predict.lm(model,x0,interval=&quot;________&quot;,conf.level=________) #&lt;&lt; 5.4 SLR Notes This is text to see what is happening. plot(pressure) I would like to embed slides into the docs. knitr::include_url(&quot;https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/slides/lab-slides/02-lab-slides.html#1&quot;) References "]
