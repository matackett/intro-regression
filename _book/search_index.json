If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

An additional goal for today is for you to be introduced to your teams and practice collaborating using GitHub and RStudio. 4.1.1 Packages We will use the following packages in today’s lab. 4.2 In-Class Exercise: Advertising Analysis In this mini analysis, we will work with the Advertising data used in Chapters 2 and 3 of Introduction to Statistical Learning. 4.3 Data and packages We start with loading the packages we’ll use. We will analyze the advertising and sales data for 200 markets. The variables we’ll use are tv: total spending on TV advertising (in $thousands) radio: total spending on radio advertising (in $thousands) newspaper: total spending on newspaper advertising (in $thousands) sales: total sales (in $millions) 4.4 Analysis We’ll begin the analysis by getting quick view of the data: Next, we can calculate summary statistics for each of the variables in the data set. What type of advertising has the smallest median spending? What type of advertising has the largest variation in spending? Describe the shape of the distribution of sales. We are most interested in understanding how advertising spending affect sales. One way to quantify the relationship between the variables is by calculating the correlation matrix. What is the correlation between radio and sales? Interpret this value. What type of advertising has the strongest linear relationship with sales? Below are visualizations of sales versus each explanatory variable. Since tv appears to have the strongest linear relationship with sales, let’s calculate a simple linear regression model using these two variables. Write the model equation. Interpret the intercept in the context of the problem. Interpret the slope in the context of the problem. 4.5 In-Class Exercise: Beer Data Analysis In this analysis, we will analyze the relationship between the amount of alcohol (PercentAlcohol) and the caloric content (CaloriesPer12Oz) in domestic beers. Let PercentAlcohol be the predictor variable and CaloriesPer12Oz the response variable. Due to limited class time, we will not do the exploratory data analysis in this example. In practice, however, you should always start with the exploratory data analysis. You can add your answers to this R Markdown document. **1. Calculate a regression model to describe the relationship between PercentAlcohol and CaloriesPer12Oz. Display the model output.* 2. Does it make sense to interpret the intercept? Why or why not? There are non-alocoholic beers, so it is possible to have a meaningful interpretation of the intercept. In our data, however, there are very few beers with less than 3% alcoholic content, so it would not be wise to interpret the intercept. It is not safe to assume the same relationship between PercentAlcohol and CaloriesPer12Oz hold for beers with 0% alcohol; this would be extrapolation. 3. Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the slope in the context of the data. We are 95% confident that the interval (26.557, 30.620) contains the true population slope for PercentAlcohol. This means we are 95% confident that for every 1% increase in alcohol content, the number of calories (per 12 oz) is expected to increase between 26.557 and 30.620 calories. 4. Find the critical value, \\(t^*\\), used to calculate the 95% confidence interval. The code below is a guide; uncomment and complete the lines of code to calculate and display the critical value. The critical value used to calculate the 95% confident interval for the slope is ______. 5. Interpret the test statistic in the context of the data The estimated slope of 28.577 is 27.78 standard errors above the hypothesized mean of 0, assuming there is no linear relationship between percent alcohol and calories in domestic beers. 6. How was the p-value calculated? Fill in the code below to calculate the p-value. The code below is a guide; uncomment and complete the lines of code to calculate and display the p-value. The p-value is _______. Given there is no linear relationship between PercentAlcohol and CaloriesPer12Oz, the probability of obtaining a test statistic with magnitude ________ or more extreme is _______. 7. Fill in the code below to calculate the predicted calories and corresponding 90% interval for a single beer with alcohol content of 4.3%. 8. Fill in the code below to calculate the predicted calories and corresponding 90% interval for the subset of beers with alcohol content of 4.3%. "],
