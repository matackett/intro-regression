class: middle, center


### Motivating Regression Analysis

---

### rottentomatoes.com

Can the ratings from movie critics be used to predict what movies the audience will like? 

--

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/movie-rating-1.png")
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/movie-rating-2.png")
```

---

### Critic vs. Audience Ratings

- To answer this question, we will analyze the critic and audience scores from rottentomatoes.com.  
    - The data was first used in the article [Be Suspicious of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandango's](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).

- Variables: 
    - **`critics`**: Tomatometer score for the film (0 - 100)
    - **`audience`**: Audience score for the film (0 - 100)
---

### `glimpse` of the data

.small[
```{r}
glimpse(movie_scores)
```

.small[
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = movie_scores,mapping = aes(x = critics)) +
  geom_histogram()
p2 <- ggplot(data = movie_scores,mapping = aes(x = audience)) +
  geom_histogram()
plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

### Terminology

- **`audience`** is the <font class="vocab">response variable $(Y)$</font>
    - variable whose variation we want to understand and/or variable we wish to predict
    - also known as *dependent*, *outcome*, *target* variable

<br>

- **`critics`** is the <font class="vocab">predictor variable $(X)$</font>
    - variable used to account for variation in the response
    - also known as *independent*
  
---

### Model 

.alert[
$$\text{audience} = f(critics) + \epsilon$$
]

We want to estimate $f$. How do we do it? 
  
---

### General form of model

.alert[
$$Y = f(\mathbf{X}) + \epsilon$$
]

- $Y$: quantitative response variable

- $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p)$: predictor variables

- $f$: fixed but unknown function
    - systematic information $\mathbf{X}$ provides about $Y$

- $\epsilon$: random error term with mean 0 that is independent of $\mathbf{X}$ 
   
---

### How to estimate $f$?

In general, we will use the following steps to estimate $f$

- Choose the functional form of $f$, i.e. <font class="vocab">choose the appropriate model given the data</font>
    - Ex: $f$ is a linear model
    $$f(\mathbf{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon$$
<br> 

--

- Use the data to fit the model, i.e. <font class="vocab">estimate the model parameters</font>
    - Ex: Use a method to estimate the model parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$

---

### Why estimate $f$?

Suppose we have the model

$$\text{audience} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{critics} + \epsilon$$
<br><br>

]

```{r echo = F}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 0, update_every = 5, warn_when = 30)
```


---

### Why estimate $f$?

There are two types of questions we may wish to answer using our model:

- <font class="vocab">Prediction: </font> What is the expected $Y$  given particular values of  $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$? 
--

    - Ex: What is the expected audience score for a movie that receives a critic score of 70%? 

--

- <font class="vocab">Inference: </font> What is the relationship between $\mathbf{X}$ and $Y$. How does $Y$ change as a function of $\mathbf{X}$?
--

    - Ex: How much can we expect the audience score to change for each additional point in the critic score?

### Simple Linear Regression

---

### Least-Squares Regression

- There is some true relationship between $X$ and $Y$ that exists in the population

$$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$

--

- If $f$ is approximated by a linear function, then we can write the relationship as 

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$ 

--

- We'll estimate the slope and intercept of this linear function using <font class = "vocab">least-squares regression</font>

--

- We'll use statistical inference to determine if the relationship we observe in the data is statistically significant or if it's due to random chance (we'll talk about this more next class)

---

### Regression Model 

$$Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X,\sigma^2)$$

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/regression.png")
```

- $\sigma$: the standard deviation of $Y$ as a function of $X$ 

- **<i>Assumption</i>:** $\sigma$ is equal for all values of $X$

---

### Regression Model

.alert[
$$Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X, \sigma^2)$$
]

--

- For a single observation $(x_i, y_i)$

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i \hspace{10mm} \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$
<br><br>
--

- We want to use the $n$ observations $(x_1,y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ to estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. We will use *least-squares regression* estimates.

---

### Residuals

```{r echo=F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
m <- lm(audience ~ critics,data=movie_scores)
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=critics,y=audience)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=critics, xend=critics, y=audience, yend=predict(m),color="red", show.legend = FALSE)) +
  labs(title="Audience Score vs. Critics Score") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The .vocab[residual] is the difference between the observed and predicted response.

---

### Residual Sum of Squares

- The residual for the $i^{th}$ observation is 

$$e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i =  y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i)$$

--

- The *residual sum of squares* is 

$$RSS = e^2_1 + e^2_2 + \dots + e^2_n$$

--


- The .vocab[least-squares regression] approach chooses coefficients $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ to minimize RSS.

---

### Estimating Coefficients

- .vocab[Slope:]

$$\hat\beta_1 = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2} = r\frac{s_y}{s_x}$$
such that $r$ is the correlation between $x$ And $y$.
<br><br>

- .vocab[Intercept:] $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{x}$

<br><br>
*Optional: [Deriving the Least-Squares Estimates for Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/sta210-sp20/supplemental-notes/blob/master/slr-derivations.pdf)*

---

### Least-Squares Model

```{r}
model <- lm(audience ~ critics, data = movie_scores)
tidy(model) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```
<br><br>

$$\hat{\text{audience}} =  32.316 + 0.519 \times \text{critics}$$

---



### Interpreting Slope & Intercept 

- <font class="vocab">Slope: </font> Increase in the mean response for every one unit increase in the predictor variable

- <font class="vocab">Intercept: </font> Mean response when the explanatory variable equals 0
<br><br>

--

- The regression equation for the Rotten Tomatoes data is
$$\hat{\text{audience}} =  32.316 + 0.519 \times \text{critics}$$

.instructions[
Write the interpretation of the slope and intercept
]

---

### Nonsensical Intercept 

- Sometimes it doesn't make sense to interpret the intercept
  + When predictor variable doesn't take values close to 0
  + When the intercept is negative even though the response variable should always be positive
  
- The intercept helps the line fit the data as closely as possible

- It is fine to have a nonsensical intercept if it helps the model give better overall predictions 

---

### Does it make sense to interpret the intercept?

- Example 1: 
    - **Explanatory**: number of home runs in a baseball game
    - **Response**: attendance at the next baseball game
<br><br>


- Example 2:
    - **Explanatory**: height of a person
    - **Response**: weight of a person

### Assessing Model Fit

---

### $R^2$
We can use the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, to measure how well the model fits the data 
- $R^2$ is the proportion of variation in $Y$ that is explained by the regression line (reported as percentage)
- It is difficult to determine what's a "good" value of $R^2$. It depends on the context of the data.

---

### Calculating $R^2$
.instructions[
$$R^2 = \frac{\text{TSS} - \text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}} = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}}$$
]
- <font class="vocab">Total Sum of Squares: </font>Total variation in the $Y$'s before fitting the regression 
$$\text{TSS}= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = (n-1)s^2_y$$

- <font class="vocab">Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): </font>Total variation in the $Y$'s around the regression line (sum of squared residuals)
$$\text{RSS} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}[y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i)]^2$$

---

### Rotten Tomatoes Data

```{r}
rsquare(model,movie_scores)
```

.alert[
The critics score explains about `r round(rsquare(model,movie_scores) * 100,2)`% of the variation in audience scores on rottentomatoes.com.

### Checking Model Assumptions 

---

### Assumptions for Regression 

1. <font class="vocab">Linearity: </font>The plot of the mean value for $y$ against $x$ falls on a straight line

2. <font class="vocab">Constant Variance: </font>The regression variance is the same for all values of $x$

3. <font class="vocab">Normality: </font> For a given $x$, the distribution of $y$ around its mean is Normal

4. <font class="vocab">Independence: </font>All observations are independent

---

### Checking Assumptions 

We can use plots of the residuals to check the assumptions for regression.

1. Scatterplot of $Y$ vs. $X$ (linearity). 
    - Check this before fitting the regression model.

2. Plot of residuals vs. predictor variable (constant variance, linearity)

3. Histogram and Normal QQ-Plot of residuals (Normality)

---

### Residuals vs. Predictor

- When all the assumptions are true, the values of the residuals reflect random (chance) error

- We can look at a plot of the residuals vs. the predictor variable

- There should be no distinguishable pattern in the residuals plot, i.e. the residuals should be randomly scattered 

- A non-random pattern suggests assumptions might be violated 

---

### Plots of Residuals

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/resid_plots.png")
```

---

```{r}
movie_scores <- movie_scores %>% mutate(residuals=resid(model))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=critics, y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red")+
  labs(title="Residuals vs. Critics Score")
```

---

### Checking Normality

- Examine the distribution of the residuals to determine if the Normality assumption is satisfied 


- Plot the residuals in a histogram and a Normal QQ plot to visualize their distribution and assess Normality

- Most inference methods for regression are robust to some departures from Normality

---

### Normal QQ-Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '100%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/normal_qqplot.png")
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=residuals)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title="Distribution of Residuals") 
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(sample=residuals)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line() +
  labs(title="Normal QQ Plot of Residuals")
```


---

### Checking Independence

- Often, we can conclude that the independence assumption is sufficiently met based on a description of the data and how it was collected. 

- Two common violations of the independence assumption: 
    - <font class="vocab">Serial Effect</font>: If the data were collected over time, the residuals should be plotted in time order to determine if there is serial correlation 

    - <font class="vocab">Cluster Effect</font>: You can plot the residuals vs. a group identifier or use different markers (colors/shapes) in the residual plot to determine if there is a cluster effect.
