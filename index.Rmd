This text was originally written as materials  for [STA 210: Regression Analysis](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring19/sta210.001/) at Duke University.The computing aspects of the assignments are written using the `tidyverse` R syntax. If R is not the computing language used in your regression course, the assignments can be adapted to fit the computing language of your choice. 

This text is a work-in-progress and will be periodically upated with new material. Please email me (<a href="mailto:maria.tackett@duke.edu">maria.tackett@duke.edu</a>) if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions. I would also love to hear about your experience if you use the text in your course.
