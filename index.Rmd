The content in this book was originally developed for [STA 210: Regression Analysis](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring19/sta210.001/) at Duke University.The computing aspects of the assignments are written using the `tidyverse` syntax in R; however, the assignments can be adapted to fit the computing language of your choice. All of the files are available in the [Intro Regression GitHub repo](https://github.com/matackett/intro-regression).

This book is under development and will be periodically upated with new material. Please email me (<a href="mailto:maria.tackett@duke.edu">maria.tackett@duke.edu</a>) if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions. I would also love to hear about your experience if you use any of the content in your course.
